When I firt brougt my cat home from the humane soceity she was a mangy, pitifull animale. It cost a lot to adoupt her: fourty dollars. And then I had to buy litter, a littrebox, food, and dishes for her to eat out of. Two days after she came home with me she got taken to the pound by the animal worden. There is a leash law for cats in Fort Collins. If they are not in your yard they have to be on a leash. Anyway, my cat is my best friend. I'm glad I got her. She sleeps under the covers with me when it is cold. Sometimes she meows a lot in the middle of the night and wakes me up, though. (unfocused)

When I first brught my cat home frm the Humane Society she was a mangy, pitiful animal. She was so thin that you could count her vertabre just by looking at her. Apperenly she was declawed by her previous owners, then abandond or lost. Since she couldn't hunt, she nearly starved. Not only that, but she had an abscess on one hip. The vets at the Humane Society had drained it, but it was still 5scabby and without12 fur. She had a terribel cold, too. She was sneezing and sniffling and her moew was just a hoarse squeak. And she woud lost half her tail somewhere. Instead of tapering gracefuly, it had a bony knob at the end. (focused)
